# Blockchain Experiments #

This repository is just a playground for me to learn Blockchain.  It has been created by following tutorials from various articles about Blockchain.

## What it does now ##

Right now, if run, "main.py" will ask you to name three "editors".  A blockchain is created tying them together.

Then, to "seal" the record so to speak, the app runs a proof.  This is a simple proof which generates random keys until a hash is created which contains six 0 characters in a row.  This is my attempt to learn how this works in the world of crypto currency.

There is much to learn, but it is pretty fun!
